Intro
================

A smart 12v fridge controller that intends to override the normal thermostate so that;
* When the device sense the 12v is being charged it targets a lower fridge temp to take advantage of the excess power
* When it senses the 12V circuit is not being charger it targets a slightly higher temp to save power
